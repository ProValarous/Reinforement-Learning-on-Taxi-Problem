# Reinforement-Learning-on-Taxi-Problem
<p> Exploration of SARSA and Q-learning algorithms on the Taxi learning problem from the 
OpenAI Gym [Toy_text] environment and comparative analysis the two in terms of:
<ul>
  <li>Computational efficiency, i.e., the time taken to converge</li>
  <li>Maximizing reward: Run the learned policies for the two algorithms from 
      various starting states and calculate the average reward to see which 
      algorithm results in more average reward.</li>
</ul>
