# Reinforement-Learning-on-Taxi-Problem
<p> 
  This project explores the implementation of SARSA and Q-learning algorithms on the Taxi problem from the OpenAI Gym Toy_text environment. The aim is to train optimal policies for the taxi agent and analyze the computational efficiency and reward maximization capabilities of the two algorithms.
